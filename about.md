# ðŸª¶ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Shiv. Iâ€™m a writer, editor, and creative teacher based in the Blue Mountains.

My background spans literary fiction, education, and digital content.  
I believe in the power of clear, evocative language â€” and I use it to help others find their voice.

This site holds fragments of that work: essays, reflections, and things still taking shape.
